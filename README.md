# Term Frequency--Inverse-Document-Frequency--(TF-IDF)

To measure an individual term, we have the tf-idf approach. “tf” means “term frequency”, measuring how frequently a term occurs in a file while “idf” means “inverse document frequency” and measures how important a term is.
 
In the given article. Sentences are scored as the sum of their TF-IDF word frequencies. Other than tf-idf, we add our own criteria to assist the operation of the summarization. These are, we assign each sentence a score between based on the percentage of per word appears in the file, assign a score based on how frequently the word is happened in the document. In short, we have some key elements that need to be considered those are tf-idf, threshold, average score.
