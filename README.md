# Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency-(TF-IDF)

To measure an individual term, we have the tf-idf approach. “tf” means “term frequency”, measuring how frequently a term occurs while “idf” means “inverse document frequency” and measures how important a term is.
 
To Run the code and understand the process of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency on skim shorter content. In short, we have some key elements that need to be considered which are tf-idf, threshold, and average score.

However, this project threshold is,
